# Daily Schedule Planner

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to design an interactive Daily Planner that allows the user to save events to their local storage to keep track and organize their daily events.  
- I designed the project to help promote organization and time management by using this daily schedule planner to help motivate users to achieve their goals.
- It consolidates information in an organized interface and saves it to let the user have everything they plan to do throughout their work day infront of them.
- I learned the complexity of JavaScript functions using APIs like Dayjs, JQuery and JSON to save items to a local storage and build an interactive application that solves a daily problem.

## Usage

The application works by opening the url (https://hershrva.github.io/DailySchedulePlanner/) in a browser. (Screenshot #1)
The User can then select a time block and enter text into the box next to the time slot they want to save the event to. The time and date is displayed at the top and the color of each time block will change depending if that event block is in the future, present or past.(Screenshot #2)
The user can then click the save button on the left to save the event to the localStorage. A message will display at the top to let the user know the selected time block that event was saved to. (Screenshot #3)
Multiple events can be saved to local storage to set a schedule for the work day.(Screenshot #4 & #5)
